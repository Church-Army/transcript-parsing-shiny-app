1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.990
Ask you transfer.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.389
Robin Ham: Oh, I'll change my name as well. Cause

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.300
Edward Graham-Hyde: yeah, it's it's weird, isn't it? It does. It is

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:26.090
Edward Graham-Hyde: right? So basically the interview. I mean we calling it an interview. But the reality is that you'll I'll send the Transcript to you once it's ready. You can add to it. It's not like one of those fair tests, Phd, level research, where you can only take the data from the interview.

5
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:35.299
Edward Graham-Hyde: And it's much more about just collecting the right information. There's gonna be some key categories to go through. So we're gonna look at your context, your wider context.

6
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:48.680
Edward Graham-Hyde: Gonna look at a little bit about how you engage with the go through all strategy as a community, and some more specifics about your initiative and what you're doing. And then a bit of opportunity fees. Provide feedback to the diocese.

7
00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:08.589
Edward Graham-Hyde: and then we'll have a little story collecting opportunity to kind of bolster some of the the got through all strategy with some stories of success, of what's happening in your community and the very end. We then got 2 really quick, single sentence questions around effective evangelism which links into my research here. I was okay.

8
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.410
Robin Ham: Right?

9
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.780
Edward Graham-Hyde: Great. Well.

10
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:24.570
Edward Graham-Hyde: first question, probably an easy one, but maybe a longer answer at the beginning, which is around, what does your context, whether it's probably defined? Your context is urban, your urban context, mean to you as a community?

11
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:35.859
Robin Ham: Yeah. So so I'm in Barrow in Furness. So Barrow is your second biggest sort of urban area in Cumbria. and we kind of

12
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:45.309
Robin Ham: yeah, I think in lots of ways. Barrow feels a little bit different to lots of Cumbria. So when people think of Cumbria, they think of rural often. or they think of tourism.

13
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.030
Robin Ham: And Barrow is kind of, yeah, is, isn't that so we are, yeah, historically, a working class town.

14
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.210
Robin Ham: and still very much

15
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:04.689
Robin Ham: yeah. Working town at the heartbeat of who we are. yeah, I've I've been here 8 and a half years. So

16
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.440
Robin Ham: it's funny in Cumbria. You have that phrase offcomer

17
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:19.189
Robin Ham: for people who come in. You're an offcomer, and I think people would say, actually, in Barrow, you're an offcomer with, you know. However, long you've been in the town. You're still, you know that you're not. You're new.

18
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:30.870
Robin Ham: Barrow is a yeah. A barrow is a place where it's, you know it's quite. It's learned to be quite independent. So because we're 45 min to the motorway

19
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:45.280
Robin Ham: because often it gets a bit of a bad press. Sometimes. people see it as a as a place of deprivation, I think often. Yeah, particularly. That comes from elsewhere in Cumbria. People might look down on it.

20
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.660
Robin Ham: So yeah, for those kind of reasons, it's a town that yeah, has learned to be quite independent, has quite strong sense of its own identity.

21
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.180
Robin Ham: may be slightly suspicious of when stuff comes from outside. You know what's the hidden motive?

22
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.879
Robin Ham: Lots of agencies and services kind of come to Barrow to help barrow

23
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:21.429
Robin Ham: and so that can lead to sort of suspicion. and yet, yeah, people have a have a great sense of pride about the town, even if they might. You know they can joke about the town. They're the ones who are allowed to kind of go.

24
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.400
Robin Ham: Oh, yeah, it's a sult or whatever we wanna get, get out.

25
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:39.979
Robin Ham: they are actually proud of what Barra brings in terms of, okay, yeah, we're building nuclear submarines nowhere else in the UK is doing that. And also, yeah, there's something about our community that is kind of.

26
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.020
Robin Ham: yeah, this this kind of that community spirit, and identity that other places.

27
00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:05.749
Robin Ham: maybe answer stronger. So yeah, I think when we first came tomorrow, like, we thought a lot of people would be wanting to get out. And you do kinda get that narrative. Particularly amongst teenagers. But we also found there's a lot of people who come back in their late twenties or thirties to have their families, because they know they're gonna get a job at Bae, and they can have a nice life.

28
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:19.920
Robin Ham:  so yeah, I guess urban town, strong sense of community in lots of ways. Big village feel lots of people with deep roots. Multi generations go going back.

29
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.120
Robin Ham: Yeah.

30
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:32.290
Robin Ham: And yet also, kind of yeah, we we see ourselves as as a, as a. as a town, with something to offer as well, I guess to to the nation in the sense of we are doing something that

31
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.190
Robin Ham: is of significance with the submarines. Basically.

32
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.389
Edward Graham-Hyde: Okay, unpack. I'm particularly

33
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:50.189
Edward Graham-Hyde: sounds kind of the pride that comes from being a is that

34
00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:03.170
Robin Ham: naturally, then, that will probably have some impact on your strategy for the Gospel. I'm wondering if you could unpack that a bit. How's it impacted your strategy for the gospel as a as a church? Yeah. So I think

35
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.450
Robin Ham: one of the things that I've kind of come to over the over the years over the years is sort of that sense of wanting to go with the grain of the place.

36
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.350
Robin Ham: and that's been a phrase I've found quite helpful.

37
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.760
Robin Ham: So actually,

38
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.819
Robin Ham: again, this idea of importing something. Obviously, often you get in like

39
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:52.739
Robin Ham: acts, or whatever you kind of. Okay, we are taking the gospel 2 places. And obviously, there's there's always a sense in which, when you you are bringing a message to people. But actually, you wanna go go with the grain of of the place and you wanna appreciate you wanna appreciate the story of the place. And actually the story of Christianity in that place. If it's a place that has had exposure to the Gospel which obviously Barrow has

40
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.509
Robin Ham: being in the Uk,

41
00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:02.940
Robin Ham: so I think, yeah. wanting to make sure that that anything I do as someone who is coming in

42
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.459
Robin Ham: is kind of

43
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.030
Robin Ham: appreciative of what is going on. I guess, like, I guess, kind of contextualization stuff. But

44
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:22.550
Robin Ham: yeah, goes with the grain in terms of the story of Christianity in this place, and and in terms of the the values of the culture. So

45
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.230
Robin Ham: not trying to be the expert who's offering something new?

46
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.910
Robin Ham: But actually, yeah, where is

47
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:41.590
Robin Ham: where is God? Up to? What's God doing in this place? How do we sort of join in with it? I guess, in kind of classic mission language.

48
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:52.469
Robin Ham: Yeah. And and I guess, being mindful of how our percept, what perception of what we're doing is all the time. So what's the perception of the ministry

49
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.089
Robin Ham: of the Church in terms of

50
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.100
Robin Ham: it not being distinct from

51
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:15.450
Robin Ham: those kind of the web, the community web in the place. If that makes sense. So it's not that we. you know, even now, with obviously went through a church. Plans, can talk about that, and then merge with a parish church in in the last 3 years.

52
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:28.690
Robin Ham: But even now, with the parish church, we're still, you know, you're still trying to make sure that actually the the Christian folk who are involved in the church are very much enmeshed in the community rather than seeing the ministry of the Church as separate.

53
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:50.800
Robin Ham: it does. And every kind of practice of evangelism level. What does that actually look like in terms? What you do?

54
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.240
Robin Ham: So I guess.

55
00:07:54.730 --> 00:08:00.310
Robin Ham: Yeah. Speaking very for myself as an individual, and I guess, with my sort of

56
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.250
Robin Ham: pass, pass the hat on. You know I am wanting to make sure that I am

57
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.089
Robin Ham: immersed in the community. So I am.

58
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:23.270
Robin Ham: there at the school gate with our kids and and getting involved in local activities that aren't church activities. So just very consciously.

59
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.970
Robin Ham: making sure that I'm I'm part of the same things that other people are. Part of.

60
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:42.589
Robin Ham: I'm yeah off. Yeah. I think, in a place like Barrow that can that can take some time. Because you're aware that yeah, people might have. And 3 generation deep sort of contacts and and webs.

61
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.700
Robin Ham: but I you know what for me. One of the sort of most significant things in the last few years is sort of helping

62
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:54.219
Robin Ham: to coach a football team for my for my son. And and just the way that actually, that

63
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.610
Robin Ham: that kind of the natural rhythms of town life. Okay, play sport be involved in

64
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:14.280
Robin Ham: football, whatever you know that, make sure you are part of those kind of rhythms and patterns of society. In the town. And I think that then just

65
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:22.179
Robin Ham: helps people see that your not trying to do something in in a kind of spiritual silo

66
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:34.089
Robin Ham: so I guess that's one example. I guess at a more church level. So more like in terms of what we're encouraging people.

67
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:46.680
Robin Ham: you know, just being big on some of the like Licc stuff on like front lines and making sure that that's a kind of a clear articulation of of how we live out. Our faith is to be

68
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:58.330
Robin Ham: a blessing to our town on our front lines, and that's very much that is part of your Christian walk. That is part of your Christian mission. And it's not that the church is trying to suck you out of all your

69
00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.660
Robin Ham: contacts.

70
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:11.290
Robin Ham: And you're kind of yeah.  the way in which you know, you've grown up in this place. So actually, yeah, course, we want you to be stuck in.

71
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:23.400
Edward Graham-Hyde: Yeah, I don't know if that's getting getting practical or concrete enough. Yeah, no, no, it's it's very much you led in a way, and that's now as we'll say. I've got a question here around.

72
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.900
Edward Graham-Hyde: what else is important to know about your context? Obviously, let's start with the fact that it is a merger

73
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:49.019
Robin Ham: and what that looks like for you. W. What should we know about that and really treat us like layman's? Here? We we we don't know. Yeah. So I guess. Yeah, I'll store my my story. My wife and I story is that we saw a pioneer curacy advertised back in 2,014.

74
00:10:49.140 --> 00:11:00.439
Robin Ham: So the Bishop apparently had said there was a bit of a trend at that time of having pioneer curates. I think there was 3 of those, maybe 2 of them in the year above me, in in the diocese.

75
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.400
Robin Ham: and the Bishop had created another one in in my ear. And so

76
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:14.529
Robin Ham: the my training minister, who was basically offered this role by the Bishop sort of looked around at the town and said, Okay, what could we do? And there was a few different options.

77
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.560
Robin Ham: And so when I came to visit and sort of for interview effectively

78
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:26.339
Robin Ham: there was a kind of a suburb of the town called Ruse and Holbeck, which is where the town has kind of expanded

79
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:40.099
Robin Ham: with housing into sort of what were separate villages. They'd identified that actually, one of the parishes stretched from Town Centre to this kind of edge of parish, and actually the parish church was in the centre, and this kind of residential

80
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:46.380
Robin Ham: suburb, a lot of owner occupied housing wasn't really being engaged with.

81
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.629
Robin Ham: So they bought a house in there. And basically we came, and and in 2015,

82
00:11:51.680 --> 00:12:04.079
Robin Ham: with a view to planting something in some way in that part of the town. so that. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, giving you a lot of detail here. But basically.

83
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:13.539
Robin Ham: you know, we, I think we really realize quickly as a couple when I say we, that the kind of the categories of planting that we had been part of in the past.

84
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.460
Robin Ham: whether it be in London or in Cheltenham.

85
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:25.850
Robin Ham: We're very much often, like a ready made good to go. Congregation, you know, start launch team.

86
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.620
Robin Ham: either starting a new congregation within an existing building or parish, or

87
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.389
Robin Ham: a new church, and and that wasn't going to happen here

88
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:45.139
Robin Ham: any time soon, because certainly the parish church that I was connected with with my curacy where my minister was looking after.

89
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:55.419
Robin Ham: They were not in a place. I think he would say in some way he had gone into what he would probably call a turn around situation, trying to in some sense revitalize.

90
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.550
Robin Ham: and so they were never going to send a bunch of people.

91
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.269
So it was very much shining.

92
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:12.280
Robin Ham: Get involved in that part of the town where we were living. Pray with Christians who lived in that part of the town, but went elsewhere to church. and pretty much we did

93
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:24.230
Robin Ham: we did a year of praying and meeting. We ran like a Lent group in in a home and tried to connect with a few people that way. We ran a evangelistic course called wonderfully made for Mums

94
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:31.930
Robin Ham:  After a year of doing that we had a year. We then started a Sunday afternoon gathering in a local school

95
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:38.169
Robin Ham: which met every 2, 3 weeks, which I guess I'd describe as like a bit like alpha. But with a kids group

96
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:49.990
Robin Ham:  and that was kind of like, a yeah, 2, 3 week thing. And then, after a year of doing that in the school, we then said, Okay, we've got a. We've kind of gathered a few people.

97
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:55.640
Robin Ham: some of whom were Christians, involved in other churches, but who had a heart for that area.

98
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:58.540
Robin Ham: some of whom were kind of on the edge of faith.

99
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:09.709
Robin Ham:  and one of the things, yeah, we just felt, basically, okay, actually, we're missing something by not being identifying as a weekly church congregation.

100
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:18.769
Robin Ham: And so we're gonna take this this kind of step of going. Okay, let's make ourselves weekly. We'll start calling ourselves Gracechurch and Grace Church barrow.

101
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.859
Robin Ham: And so we went for it Sunday afternoons for a year.

102
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.940
Robin Ham: And that was good like. But again we were kind of

103
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:33.070
Robin Ham: we, you know we'd run Christmas stuff carol services for the community. We ran other courses.

104
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:44.520
Robin Ham:  but you know, we were always really small. We were maybe you know, we might be between 12 and 25 people, including children on a Sunday

105
00:14:44.860 --> 00:15:02.359
Robin Ham: and one of the things we came kept coming up against is actually lots of the the non-christian folk or folk who wouldn't identify as as church goers who were interested in finding out more was saying. Sunday afternoons isn't great for us, because that's when we hang out with family. That's when we go and see the grandparents.

106
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:09.019
Robin Ham: Sunday sort of dinner, Sunday lunch being a kind of a big connection point families.

107
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:19.589
Robin Ham: So after a year of doing that, we actually shifted to a morning and we moved to a slightly different venue, a Working Men's Club, because it gave us a bit more flexibility. It was a bit more cozier

108
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:27.300
Robin Ham:  and had a year of that. No one that yeah, no, we had basically had 18 months of that had had.

109
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:41.290
Robin Ham: I was kind of enjoying that year. I transitioned from pioneer curate to pioneer minister. So the curacy kind of ended, and they put Bishop appointed me as a kind of a pioneer minister to lead that

110
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.800
Robin Ham: church plant.

111
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.740
Robin Ham: We were. Yeah, we were slightly bigger than

112
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:54.500
Robin Ham: but again, it was still very kind of yeah. Small scale, starting from scratch. Kind of thing.

113
00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:11.929
Robin Ham: but yeah, had an you know, had amazing some amazing moments. Had had a 4 guys baptized on East to Sunday 2019, which was really kind of special in in a kind of baps history out the back on this Bowling Green

114
00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.789
Edward Graham-Hyde: by the Working Men's club.

115
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:20.350
Robin Ham:  But one of the things that happened to us in the summer around September 20,

116
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:34.009
Robin Ham: 2019, just after that is, 6 adults who were kind of involved in stuff, all left Barrow for different reasons. So one was an intern who was only here for a year, but then the others were all

117
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:42.149
Robin Ham: in some form of employment, or couple with someone else who was employed. And and they basically all moved away at different points within about 3 months.

118
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:51.050
Robin Ham: So we had this meeting of the core team in January 2020 where we were like, yeah, this is becoming quite hard, like we've kind of our

119
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.689
Robin Ham: in terms of our core core mass.

120
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.620
Robin Ham: Critical mass was struggling

121
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.870
Robin Ham: on a Sunday and that almost seems like it's affecting people's.

122
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:09.460
Robin Ham:  people sticking with it because they don't quite. We almost too small to be sort of a viable

123
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:18.740
Robin Ham: gathering points. The building went through a change of management as well, which meant we were not able to use it as much midweek as we'd wanted to.

124
00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:33.629
Robin Ham: And yeah, basically, they were wanting to kind of push us out, really, because we weren't financially bringing them in. And they basically had to bring in a couple to run the Working Men's club as a bar. And so this couple were like, well, you're not gaining us any pints. So

125
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:49.409
Robin Ham:  I think. Yeah, we knew that something had to change. This is January 2020. And of course, then everything did change, hey? And in lots of ways. That was a real gift to us to have kind of lockdown because it meant it gave us the space to to rethink.

126
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:58.840
Robin Ham: Obviously, front door becomes online world. And we did a lot of stuff online. And and as everyone did sort of adapted to that.

127
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:07.790
Robin Ham: But basically one of the things we began exploring in. Probably in the May there was a parish in an barrow, basically has 8 parishes.

128
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:17.370
Robin Ham: It's that kind of size. So one of the parishes. Was in a vacancy. There's a church that had an evangelical history.

129
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:25.230
Robin Ham: Ha! Had a really good building, had some great people, but basically, the diocese had said that wasn't money for a replacement

130
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.820
Robin Ham: and they'd been relying on an associate minister part time.

131
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:42.919
Robin Ham: So we just it just gave us the space to go. Actually, maybe there's something in emerging. Maybe that's the wise thing for the next step of this journey, for everyone, for both churches, but also for the town

132
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:52.860
Robin Ham: and so went through this whole merger process, which was completely new to us all, and didn't really have anywhere to go to. Kind of work out how to do that, but we kind of

133
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:58.980
Robin Ham: work, figured it out, and worked our way through sort of thing. And got to the point

134
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:08.900
Robin Ham: whereby, in the November we both Church is given a green light. To this I was then licenses, basically the the incumbent off the parish, which was called St. Paul's.

135
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:24.050
Robin Ham: It's about a 6 min drive from where we were meeting to the parish church, and we found that actually most of the people who were involved in the church plants were happy with that, because actually, 6 min in the car in Barrow is nothing.

136
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:39.550
Robin Ham:  And actually, one of the things was that the people we were reaching in that part of town were people who were actually relatively mobile. So for them, it wasn't a distinct community that necessarily needed that physical church on the street

137
00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.020
Robin Ham: cause. They were happy to get in the car, to go to the gym, or to go to work or whatever.

138
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:49.119
Robin Ham:  so yeah, so that's basically been an interesting journey. And basically the last

139
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:55.380
Robin Ham: sort of yeah, I guess since January 2021, which is when I was. I think, officially licensed.

140
00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:11.939
Robin Ham: It's kind of been about, okay, how do we? How do we keep going in this merger? How do we try and make sure we have one identity. But we're not simply an amalgamation into the parish, but that the plant brings something and something of its story. That means we've got that kind of

141
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.200
Robin Ham: missional thinking.

142
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.499
Robin Ham: yeah, I've talked a lot there, but really, really helpful.

143
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:29.120
Edward Graham-Hyde: yeah. So obviously, you define as church plan. And well, I'm assuming you do, rather than a fresh expression or anything else.

144
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:43.779
Edward Graham-Hyde: There are advantages and disadvantages that come to that. I'm just wondering if you had any reflections on what those advantages and disadvantages of being defined as a church plant, both within your diocese, but also generally has been.

145
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:54.070
Robin Ham: Yeah. It's been a really interesting thing over the last 8 years, because there was this kind of category of pioneer curates, and they were all kind of expected to pioneer in some way.

146
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.709
Robin Ham: And I think when the dioces first did that, they didn't really know what to do with

147
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:20.240
Robin Ham: them, they thought, this is a good idea. But okay, what do we do? So we were actually sent to be coached by a guy from Wigan. Who kind of had the experience, and that was that was a happy time for a year sort of thing, but I think it probably showed that the dioces didn't really know what to do. Then, I think, yeah, we had, like Richard Passmore appointed. With kind of fresh expressions, lead.

148
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:30.519
Robin Ham: And I think, yeah, for me, like my background was always in the language of church planting and that would be my kind of natural go to.

149
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.640
Robin Ham: and I think, probably bound up with that

150
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.619
Robin Ham: is probably kind of more

151
00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.200
Robin Ham: clear

152
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:45.719
Robin Ham: goals in terms of the the sense of a kind of a an ecclesial community that

153
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:57.469
Robin Ham: looks like church in some way that that is willing to ask questions and do church outside the box, but probably has some fairly defined kind of theological categories for what

154
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.289
Robin Ham: it should look like, or at least what the core convictions behind, whatever it looks like, are

155
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:09.469
Robin Ham: whereas I think fresh expressions probably has felt in the dice is a little bit more vague.

156
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:16.460
Robin Ham:  and and question marks maybe about the place of discipleship.

157
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.170
Robin Ham:  within that. So

158
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:30.910
Robin Ham: I think calling ourselves a church plant, has been helpful in some ways, because it's also given us clarity with local people as to what we're trying to be about. We are.

159
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:42.629
Robin Ham: This is trying to be church. And that's something. Okay. They know what church is. But this is clearly different. But okay, that's okay. Because I know it's meant to be church, even though there are those differences.

160
00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:56.840
Robin Ham: But I think there probably has been a sense of the narrative in Co. In Cumbria has been around fresh expressions. and so those who have been involved in church planting have maybe, or used that language more have kind of not necessarily

161
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:04.560
Robin Ham: have. Yeah. Struggled to kind of I don't know. Maybe fit in, or certainly sort of get support. So

162
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:15.470
Robin Ham: yeah, for my, I think for years, the first year of the church plant, I ended up doing a course in Manchester on church planting, because the diocese sort of recognized that there wasn't really any

163
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.370
Robin Ham: anyone really doing it within the diocese

164
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.059
Robin Ham: and calling it that

165
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.449
Robin Ham: And and yeah, that there were, there were maybe differences with with the fresh expressions training and input.

166
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.579
Robin Ham: As to what I was doing?

167
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.960
Edward Graham-Hyde: Okay? Yeah. So helpful.

168
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:45.370
Edward Graham-Hyde: similar question. But more round, what does being in the diocese of Carlyle bring in terms of advantages, disadvantages to you as a church plant.

169
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.250
Robin Ham: So I think

170
00:23:49.260 --> 00:24:02.829
Robin Ham: that I mean, obviously, lots of people will say Cumbria is massive, and so it's a hard, although it's a small diocese in terms of people and personalities. It's a big diocese in terms of actually seeing people and feeling connected. I think.

171
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:16.810
Robin Ham: being part of an Anglican diocese. I don't know I did. That being part being part of the Anglican diocese has been helpful in terms of locally just people knowing you're you're an ordained minister.

172
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.990
Robin Ham: I think, has brought brought weight

173
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:28.000
Robin Ham: particularly because it's okay. You're you are Anglican, your Church of England, but your church planting. So okay, II do get you more.

174
00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.160
Robin Ham: I'm willing for you to come into the school and do assemblies.

175
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.770
Robin Ham: yeah, II see this is part of the Church of England's kind of mission

176
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.100
Robin Ham: and resourcing in the town. So I think it's helped people to see.

177
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:53.530
Robin Ham: Yeah, give me a kind of a legitimacy. and I think in terms of the dioces. Probably it's been more about individual support. So, for example, the previous Bishop, Bishop James

178
00:24:53.830 --> 00:25:03.650
Robin Ham: was personally really supportive. I guess I always knew that it was him who'd sort of. you know, come up with the idea of the curacy. It was him who then

179
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:10.720
Robin Ham: sort of talked with my training incumbent, and basically was happy to give the green light to the pioneer minister role

180
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.350
Robin Ham: beyond the curacy.

181
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:16.669
Robin Ham: It was him who was then kind of very happy for us to explore the merger.

182
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:22.710
Robin Ham: So I guess I always have found there's been that relational support.

183
00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:29.460
Robin Ham: Not necessarily that kind of like. Okay, our expertise or I get you. And you know this is all part of a big strategy, but

184
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.200
Robin Ham: at least the kind of a

185
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.750
Robin Ham: I'm happy to bless what you're doing sort of thing, even though it's a bit different.

186
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:46.790
Robin Ham: I think that would probably be the big thing. Because I think, actually, yeah, there hasn't been that web of church planting thinking within the diocese.

187
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.430
Robin Ham: So that's not been something that we've kind of benefited from

188
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.250
Robin Ham: And I think probably

189
00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:03.410
Robin Ham: maybe a personal level again. Yeah, it became clear that the fresh expressions thing was quite different and therefore wasn't gonna be a natural kind of fit

190
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.459
Robin Ham: in terms of support networks.

191
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.269
Robin Ham: For what we were doing.

192
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.080
Edward Graham-Hyde: Yeah. very good. And

193
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:20.630
Robin Ham: have any more questions in that kind of context field. It's more around. Let's zoom in zooming more into the golf rule strategy stuff, then.

194
00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:21.950
Edward Graham-Hyde: So

195
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:36.319
Edward Graham-Hyde: yep, dog rule strategy. It's a big vision. I think. Big got quite a few values that come out of it as well. I'm just wondering how's the strategy impacted your community at all. What is it? Or is it more, you know.

196
00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:42.640
Edward Graham-Hyde: with you as a leadership team? Has it impacted the whole community. What does the Godfrey strategy look like for you guys?

197
00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:48.740
Robin Ham: And by strategy are we talking about the more kind of recent kind of

198
00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:57.969
Robin Ham: yeah, definition of it. So yeah. Cause, I guess when got roll was first launched, it was kind of like, okay, I think a lot of people just felt, okay.

199
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:05.400
Robin Ham: brilliant. But this is what the church is about, anyway. Right? This is about reaching everyone. I think? Yeah. So

200
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:19.500
Robin Ham: obviously, I think when the yeah, the strategy was sort of relaunched with specific strands to it. That was in the context of the merger. So post covid.  So I think in lots of ways it

201
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:26.709
Robin Ham: in some ways. Yet it has helped give clear focus. So, for example, that was the growing younger element of the strategy.

202
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.339
Robin Ham: And so

203
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:36.390
Robin Ham: one of the things we were doing locally as part of the new identity of the church was, what are our going to be our vision priorities as a church.

204
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:44.239
Robin Ham: And so we ended up one of those choosing one of those to be growing younger, and that was partly because we knew it was a diocesan

205
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:53.380
Robin Ham: part of the dust and strategy. And so it felt like, this is, this is buying into that. And it's kind of showing how it yeah works out on the ground.

206
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.559
Robin Ham: But also, I think, yeah, trying to say to the diocese again, we want to take this seriously.

207
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:12.140
Robin Ham:  I think. you know. Yeah, I guess part of the the dicey stuff has been about the mixed ecology. Different kinds of church.

208
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:25.850
Robin Ham: fresh expressions and time-honored. And so I think again, that's kind of helpfully recognise that. Yeah, maybe our story is a bit of a funny story, but it it kind of can. It's valued within that.

209
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.840
Robin Ham:  But to be honest, I don't think beyond that

210
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.950
Robin Ham: much.

211
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.670
Robin Ham:  yeah. Reality.

212
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:52.130
Edward Graham-Hyde: Yeah. So you told, yeah, you told a little bit about implementation in there which I think probably covered that question around how you're implementing it, and I guess more of an even better if about the strategy, if you had one. If you have any, doesn't matter if you don't

213
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.800
Robin Ham: say again, if if a a

214
00:28:54.810 --> 00:29:03.979
Edward Graham-Hyde: like an even better, I'm a I'm a former teacher, I should say so. That kind of what went well, even better. If, when you mark even better, if about the god through all strategy.

215
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:13.790
Robin Ham:  yeah. So my own sort of feeling would be that when we re looked at the strategy

216
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.550
Robin Ham: we we have. We haven't been ruthless enough.

217
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:30.730
Robin Ham: So I think lots of people initially felt. Okay, golf role is just it's blanket. And it's a good heading. And we've got this 4 kind of themes. you know. Tread gently, speak boldly.

218
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:43.870
Robin Ham: follow daily. Care deeply. Okay, but that's still quite broad and isn't really a strategy. Okay? Then we came up with the the different elements of the new strategy. But we haven't actually been

219
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.700
Robin Ham: ruthless in in that. It still feels like it's basically we're coming up with a

220
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:57.749
Robin Ham: a label and a strategy that covers everything rather than actually focusing us  and helping us make

221
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.449
Robin Ham: harder decisions on the ground.

222
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:07.850
Robin Ham: So I think, yeah, at a local level. And Barrow, as we look at kind of the church scene and the mission community.

223
00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.860
Robin Ham: that strategy hasn't really helped us

224
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.400
Robin Ham: be ruthless or be kind of

225
00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:27.110
Robin Ham: strategic in terms of the decisions we are making. It feels like it's still a kind of it's a way of letting everything carry on to exist. But just acknowledging there's a lot of things existing

226
00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:43.290
Edward Graham-Hyde: if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah, specifics is kind of the next section. Zooming again, a little bit more

227
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:53.680
Robin Ham: into what you guys are. And actually, this question is more to you as the leader in what success looks like to you in your context.

228
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.430
Robin Ham: So I think.

229
00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:06.110
Robin Ham:  I think I often think about success in terms of individuals

230
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:13.450
Robin Ham: growing in their faith. But those individuals being being people who are enmeshed in their community.

231
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.349
Robin Ham: and that therefore, having ripples of of impact.

232
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.460
Robin Ham: So

233
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.649
Robin Ham: yeah, I guess that's

234
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:32.169
Robin Ham: one of the things I kind of I value. And one of the things II you know, I hope for. What we're doing at the moment is that actually

235
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:45.220
Robin Ham: were not just trying to gather a crowd under the banner of St. Paul's Barrow. Whether we are that? Yeah, the individual people are being are growing, but they're then being sent out onto their front lines, and

236
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.060
Robin Ham: and because they are rooted in the town already, they are then having an impact.

237
00:31:50.480 --> 00:32:02.179
Robin Ham: So they're sharing the gospel or there talking more about their faith with with colleagues or family or  because I think probably there is.

238
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:11.490
Robin Ham: There's always that. I guess it's the same in lots of places. But there's that danger where you measure, change by the clergy and what they are achieving and doing.

239
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.649
Robin Ham: or even the kind of the programs that the clergy are doing at the church.

240
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:22.809
Robin Ham: but I think in terms of the success stories. You know that as I look at what

241
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:33.679
Robin Ham: the last 8 years and what we've been privileged to be involved in it is it's individuals who are who are, who, yeah, maybe identified as Christian. And you've just sort of helped them to kind of

242
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.750
Robin Ham: Owen, that faith

243
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:44.539
Robin Ham: publicly or people who've come to faith. And then a kind of that's causing surprise and reaction, and other people being drawn in.

244
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.269
Robin Ham: That's the kind of the success. Yeah.

245
00:32:49.360 --> 00:33:00.969
Edward Graham-Hyde: And yeah, I mean, naturally, when you ask a question about success, you'd follow along with what challenges have you faced? But I feel like, unless there's anything additional feel like you've covered a lot around the challenges that you face.

246
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:08.520
Edward Graham-Hyde: You know, pre post Covid. I don't know if there's like individual things that you might draw on, or yeah,

247
00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:15.400
Robin Ham: I mean, I think one of the things that personally, we've had to kind of process is like, well.

248
00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.630
Robin Ham: what does

249
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.769
Robin Ham: church planting looked like in a place like Barrow.

250
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:28.640
Robin Ham: where roots go deep and where you don't have lots of resources. And in some ways, yeah, the last 8 years that has been the

251
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:34.360
Robin Ham: that's been the story of the last 8 years, and we are. We are where we are sort of thing.

252
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:45.970
Robin Ham: so, and I think I guess I probably felt 8 years ago that I there wasn't many places to turn. or I didn't know where to turn 4

253
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.619
Robin Ham: kind of guidance on that.

254
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:58.709
Robin Ham: I felt those lots of places to turn. If I wanted to start a new congregation in the city, and I had 25 people to start it with me.

255
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:03.980
Robin Ham: but yeah, yeah. So I think that's probably been the big challenge.

256
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:06.459
Robin Ham: yeah, we've had to work through

257
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:28.690
Edward Graham-Hyde:  bit of a cheeky question is because speaking as a church plan. So I know that this is always bit like, no, wouldn't change anything. We're doing really well. But if there's anything you would change, maybe you know that you started building in right from the beginning that has kind of just permeated through. About what you're doing. If there's anything you change about your church plan, what would it be? And why?

258
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.940
Robin Ham: Yeah, that's a great question.

259
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:49.400
Robin Ham: it's weird. Because we've kind of yeah, yeah, you kind of, I guess. Big picture like stuff. We, you know we've we've kind of it. Felt it felt like we kind of just

260
00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:56.229
Robin Ham: sort of taken steps along the way, and we've ended up where we are, and we didn't know really know where we were going.

261
00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:04.660
Robin Ham: but we sort of trust God in that process, and I think generally that it would have been difficult to do anything apart from that.

262
00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.340
Robin Ham:  I think.

263
00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:12.799
Robin Ham:  I think there's always a thing about like

264
00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:20.960
Robin Ham: making sure that my time is invested into the local community into normal relationships.

265
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.330
Robin Ham: And

266
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.329
Robin Ham: and I think, like.

267
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:35.299
Robin Ham: in our situation with the time limits of the curacy, there was always that kind of pressure to get to the point where you could call something a church

268
00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.650
Robin Ham: and

269
00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:44.960
Robin Ham: maybe the price of that in terms of energy and time is.

270
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.680
Robin Ham: how much time and energy is it taking away from investing in just normal relationships?

271
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:58.849
Robin Ham:  and I think certainly since the merger there's then been, that's that's probably look slightly differently.

272
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.510
Robin Ham: It's more look like

273
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.469
Robin Ham: the the the institution church is a parish.

274
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.860
Robin Ham: Take so much time. and therefore how much

275
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.150
Robin Ham: time is being squeezed away from actually.

276
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.070
Robin Ham: yeah, relationship with people outside church.

277
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:15.490
Edward Graham-Hyde: Yeah.

278
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.420
Robin Ham: I hear you. I can't hear you

279
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:29.520
Edward Graham-Hyde: in terms of other church plants and initiatives within the diocese, and maybe even outside, what could they learn from you specifically as a church plant?

280
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:36.460
Robin Ham: Yeah, I mean, yeah. When when we talked about when we first, when I first heard that they were bidding for this?

281
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:45.239
Robin Ham: The church planting kind of brief. Brief? Okay? Yeah. I guess my ears did prick up because it felt slightly like, Okay, wow.

282
00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.740
Robin Ham: we've been doing this for in 8 for 8 years in Cumbria.

283
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:56.270
Robin Ham: But it doesn't really feel like we've been asked like, Okay, how did you find it? And what should this look like?

284
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.940
Robin Ham:  like, I think.

285
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:14.229
Robin Ham: yeah, it's the recognition that roots go deep in Cumbria. And so it needs to be something. It needs to go with the grain. It takes time. Because relationships take time.

286
00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:24.099
Robin Ham:  I think. Yeah, it's interesting that I think there's always that kind of that idea that church planting is. You can just magically bring people in.

287
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:34.480
Robin Ham: And even over the last 3, 4 years there's been that question around Barrow. Like is the solution to get a resource church from somewhere else in the North West to send a bunch of people

288
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.669
Robin Ham: the barrow.

289
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.930
Robin Ham: but just yeah.

290
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.330
Robin Ham: Not necessarily convinced that that is going to be

291
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.100
Robin Ham: the thing that has a lasting impact.

292
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:51.439
Robin Ham: I guess the value of the existing sort of

293
00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:56.109
Robin Ham: spiritual locations, church buildings.

294
00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:02.849
Robin Ham:  and and just being given time and energy to invest.

295
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:09.990
Robin Ham: whilst also having, I would say, quite, yeah, quite focused kind of categories

296
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.810
Robin Ham: in terms of thinking about what you're doing and what you're trying to achieve.

297
00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:29.240
Robin Ham: Yeah, I didn't feel I've necessarily settled. I could say that. But no. Well, let me press you a bit further, because that's really interesting. You saying, you know you've you've resisted the temptation of having a resource church just parachute a bunch of people, and

298
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:33.980
Edward Graham-Hyde: maybe I'm reflecting on. Maybe it's a bit more evangelical in my experience. But

299
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:39.669
Edward Graham-Hyde: bodies on the ground, you know. That's that's what every church plaster wants. So

300
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.769
Edward Graham-Hyde: on a practical level. How are you then.

301
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.850
Edward Graham-Hyde: getting the most out of the people you've got, rather than saying yes to bringing more people in. What is it you do with them?

302
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:58.999
Robin Ham: And you know we but we probably have said yes in little ways. So we've you know we've received in turns. We've

303
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.150
Robin Ham: you know we would give

304
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.290
Robin Ham: given a cure it so I guess I have seen that in little ways.

305
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.400
Robin Ham: and we've had the benefit of Christians who've moved into the area

306
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:20.580
Robin Ham: being involved. But I guess it's that sense of being confident that that that is working with the existing

307
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.740
Robin Ham: and

308
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:34.580
Robin Ham: and all the stuff around. Therefore, how? How the church is perceived in the community. Just that. I guess that feeling really important and precious.

309
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:39.480
Robin Ham:  and and it not just being about

310
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.240
Robin Ham: gathering a crowd or being

311
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:49.589
Robin Ham: kind of the a show in town. Sort of thing.  what? What?

312
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:54.539
Edward Graham-Hyde: if you have to put a percentage to it? What percentage split to people who've moved in

313
00:39:54.680 --> 00:40:00.169
Edward Graham-Hyde: to local people who've grown up there or grown up, and then returned. And have you got any church?

314
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.969
Robin Ham: It's a great question.

315
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:10.130
Robin Ham: I? Well, yeah. So it's funny, because actually, you'd be surprised how many people

316
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:14.350
Robin Ham: even who've been around in Barrow for 40 50 years

317
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:21.649
Robin Ham: at 1 point weren't in Barrow. So amongst the key members of the church, I still think.

318
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:28.289
Robin Ham: although there's people who've been involved, for example, in Saint Paul's as a parish, for. be, as I say 30, 40 years.

319
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:33.800
Robin Ham: maybe even more turns out they they, they move to borrow for a job.

320
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.320
Robin Ham: So I think that

321
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:41.370
Robin Ham: yeah part of me again, going back to these success. You know the success stories.

322
00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:48.019
Robin Ham: Pardon me. Still go. It kind of goes. Okay? Well, actually. it feels like we're not scratching the surface

323
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.180
Robin Ham: in terms of actual local people whose

324
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:56.710
Robin Ham: commitment? Who? Yeah, who generationally go back?

325
00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.620
Robin Ham:  So?

326
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.549
Robin Ham: I mean, yeah. In terms of the the St. Paul's church congregation?

327
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.219
Robin Ham: I mean, probably there'd be maybe like

328
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.929
Robin Ham: then I

329
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:15.239
Robin Ham: 30% who who've come to Barrow in the last 5 years?

330
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:22.919
Robin Ham: Which maybe is quite high. But then, if you ask, yeah, who's been in Barrow who was born in Barrow?

331
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:29.960
Robin Ham: I don't know for sure. But I wonder if it maybe is even as high as like 80% weren't born in Barrow.

332
00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.320
Edward Graham-Hyde: I am.

333
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.470
Robin Ham: So

334
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.859
Robin Ham: I wonder if I wonder if there's a

335
00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:39.900
Robin Ham: a thing there about just historically, how? Well with

336
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.149
Robin Ham: connected and

337
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.370
Robin Ham: or just what? Yeah, what?

338
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.429
Robin Ham: How borough people think of church?

339
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.150
Robin Ham: that I guess we're starting to maybe

340
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.720
Robin Ham: break down and challenge. I don't know. Yeah.

341
00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:06.070
Edward Graham-Hyde: okay, so okay, sounds complex. Maybe these research. Okay?

342
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:24.739
Edward Graham-Hyde: yeah. The question bit of a different topic. But still within, I guess. Fitting to to go through stuff as well a little bit. What new ways, if it's all, if you've managed to. I know it's you know everyone's sort of coming out of Covid and starting again. Almost have you created in terms of reaching a diverse and younger people?

343
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:25.760
Robin Ham: Hmm.

344
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.600
Robin Ham: so

345
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:40.909
Robin Ham: we at Simple's. We basically yeah. One of the first things we did, I guess, after the merger and after Covid is, we came up with these vision priorities. And one of them being growing younger.

346
00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:43.030
Robin Ham: So that has kind of

347
00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:51.260
Robin Ham: we've been trying to implement that in different ways. So we started. Well, we yeah, it had had some historical form.

348
00:42:51.370 --> 00:43:05.790
Robin Ham: But we changed it quite differently. II basically young people's drop in after school. So our location as a church building is on to kind of a crossroads with 2 kind of main roads. So

349
00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:14.839
Robin Ham: trying to basically recognize that actually, the people who we we've got a lot of kids in primary school who are part of the church community through parents or grandparents, but

350
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:20.359
Robin Ham: very few secondary. So we we just we need to just make contacts really rather than

351
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:27.140
Robin Ham: through existing relationships. and

352
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:33.889
Robin Ham: yes, trying to basically re ignite schools. Ministry. So

353
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.630
a presence

354
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:40.020
Robin Ham: in in the church school at least. But then.

355
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.110
Robin Ham: yeah, trying to

356
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:47.630
Robin Ham: pick up on basically classic things like assemblies. In in the local schools.

357
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.350
Robin Ham:  try and run a termly

358
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:56.770
Robin Ham: event that's aimed at families on like a Saturday or a Friday evening

359
00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:02.620
Robin Ham: as a kind of an evangelistic thing. So whether that's a pancake party, or we're doing

360
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.210
Robin Ham: a light party coming up those kind of obvious kind of feeder

361
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.370
Robin Ham: events.

362
00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:17.310
Robin Ham: one of the things that we're about to launch now, so I guess it's been a few months in the pipeline is.

363
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:28.419
Robin Ham: As I said, we've got a number of people who are in upper years of primary school, so trying to put something on that is like a a a group for them, but for them to invite their friends to

364
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.389
Robin Ham: midweek. so like, and like an evening

365
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:46.219
Robin Ham: kind of discipleship group, but slightly like an evangelistic group as well. So going well, these are the young people we've got. How do we help them to reach out to their friends? But also build them up in the face.

366
00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:52.409
Robin Ham: So that's about to go live in a couple of weeks after half term.

367
00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:05.390
Robin Ham: diverse like, I guess generally we've been trying to just be big on Everyone's welcome. Nobody's perfect with Jesus. There's always hope that's our kind of

368
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.299
Robin Ham: kind of slogan.

369
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:16.009
Robin Ham: So tryin to get behind the idea that you only expect certain people to come to church every Sunday is a Sunday where you can invite someone.

370
00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:21.429
Robin Ham: We wanna expect people to be there. Therefore we're gonna run

371
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:24.319
Robin Ham: that alpha or Cristan is explored regularly.

372
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:34.179
Robin Ham:  we are. Yeah, I mean, I guess I don't know if these are all obvious things. But so even our like, our discipleship groups.

373
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:35.519
Robin Ham: home groups.

374
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:48.379
Robin Ham: we follow a 1, 2, 3 go pattern. So we meet 1, one and 3, and then we pray week, 2, and then week 4. We just say make space for actually hanging out with your non Christian friends.

375
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.780
Robin Ham: So we're just trying to build that into the culture.

376
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:59.529
Robin Ham:  I think, yeah, it's interesting. II think that they were massively diverse as a congregation. But

377
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:11.360
Robin Ham: there's definitely people who you might not think see, particularly churchy, etc., and it's trying to just celebrate that and make sure those voices are seen and heard.

378
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:25.099
Robin Ham:  we've yeah, we I mean, one of the interesting things actually, in the last year has been again, not really through anything of our doing is we've had a bunch of Iranian guys turn up because one had a personal contact with

379
00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:40.229
Robin Ham: I knew of a pastor who knew me, and this one of the guys had moved from another town and Barrow Hotel suddenly started being a government sort of holding place. And so that's helped us kind of be diverse for a year. But we've not. We've not really. We didn't really do anything to

380
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:49.549
Robin Ham: to to make that happen, but I guess we've had to then adapt to go work out. If we are this diverse, how do we make sure we are this diverse in terms of

381
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.000
Robin Ham: involving them?

382
00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.030
Robin Ham: yeah.

383
00:46:53.400 --> 00:47:06.640
Edward Graham-Hyde: So so there's lots there, there's you know. Most people know that when you bring in initiatives, when you kind of do things that are analystically focused, that also develops the people involved in them, that you're up there in your community.

384
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:24.129
Edward Graham-Hyde: any kind of initial big developments or kind of in people in your community around create additional practice that, you see is, is it changes the dynamic a little bit? Is there more energy? Or is it less energy? Because there's more things happening? What? What's your observation?

385
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.959
Robin Ham: Yeah. Good question.

386
00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.100
Robin Ham: you know, on some, yeah, on different different levels, I guess, like

387
00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.060
Robin Ham: the front line thing I mentioned.

388
00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:43.000
Robin Ham: So I think that as silly and maybe as obvious as it might seem, it has been quite a radical shift for people. because I think.

389
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:48.490
Robin Ham: certainly within the existing church mission was

390
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.029
Robin Ham: something that the activities the church did.

391
00:47:51.350 --> 00:48:01.389
Robin Ham: And we're we're basically saying, actually, no mission is also what you are doing the rest of the week. And I think we can see that that is having an impact in terms of the way that

392
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:08.109
Robin Ham: church members articulate what they're doing in their lives and and their calling.

393
00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:15.210
Robin Ham: Excuse me And therefore feeling empowered or feeling envisioned to think about.

394
00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:27.109
Robin Ham:  the value of of what they're doing elsewhere in their family at work.  yeah, I guess nothing dramatic, but just like

395
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:38.310
Robin Ham: the value of giving people areas of responsibility. So just saying, Well, you're gonna be involved in actually helping develop this young person drop in. And we don't really know what it looks like, or

396
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:45.470
Robin Ham: we haven't mapped it all out yet. But, You can see the value of. We need to connect with

397
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:49.330
younger younger demographic.

398
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.139
Robin Ham: So have a go.

399
00:48:52.690 --> 00:49:00.499
Robin Ham: yeah. I guess that kind of have a go. Mentality is something we've been trying to just on the line. It's okay to try different things.

400
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:08.070
Robin Ham: Kind of at the same time have a kind of scattered approach to to some of these things like growing younger and and see what

401
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.450
Robin Ham: God does.

402
00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.810
Robin Ham:  yeah.

403
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:20.720
Robin Ham: And and then I think I mean, one of my personal book bears is just making sure people have the time.

404
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.309
Robin Ham: So to actually to be

405
00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:26.170
Robin Ham: in their communities and and so tryin to be.

406
00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:32.169
Robin Ham: And I think that's been interesting, because sometimes that has been saying, No, we're not gonna do

407
00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.560
Robin Ham: another.

408
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.250
Robin Ham: I don't know social event, or

409
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:43.220
Robin Ham: we're gonna not gonna ask that person to do this job. So that because we know that she's really important. They have more time.

410
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:52.459
Edward Graham-Hyde:  yeah, okay, alright, really, helpful, okay, bit of an opportunity for feedback before we kind of

411
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.480
Edward Graham-Hyde: land the plane, in a really nice area around stories.

412
00:49:55.620 --> 00:50:05.789
Edward Graham-Hyde: Any feedback you give to the to the diocese about specifically kind of feedback that emanates out of your community something you'd like to say back.

413
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:13.480
Robin Ham:  yes.

414
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.880
Robin Ham: it's a good question.

415
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:22.990
Robin Ham: This is like feeding. Yeah, what my feeding back to, I guess. Yeah, I mean, I think that

416
00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:29.299
Robin Ham: we want. Yeah, we want, we want to keep freeing people up to

417
00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:37.089
Robin Ham: to do new initiatives.  we. We want to

418
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:43.649
Robin Ham: part of that freeing. often freeing clergy up and even freeing laity up, is

419
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:51.899
Robin Ham: making hard decisions that release them from other responsibilities. Whether that is running X number of services

420
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:56.140
Robin Ham: on a Sunday around the the local area, or whether it's

421
00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:05.639
Robin Ham:  you know, burdening them with church warden or burdening them with, you know this role or that role and therefore

422
00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:17.240
Robin Ham: them, they're not actually having the capacity to do stuff. So I think there's probably something around making those hard decisions and and coming up with frameworks and pathways to allow

423
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:23.779
Robin Ham:  yeah, churches to change shape, basically, deaneries to change shape

424
00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.879
Robin Ham: so that new things can emerge without.

425
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:30.380
Robin Ham: Yeah, people have the time to allow new things to emerge.

426
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:37.490
Robin Ham:  yeah,

427
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.060
Robin Ham: and I think, yeah, I think, maybe just being a bit more.

428
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:52.110
Robin Ham:  yeah, I don't know being a bit more ruthless in terms of actually, we want to celebrate the stories of

429
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.730
Robin Ham: church growth.

430
00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.770
Robin Ham: and therefore we need to. Yeah, I guess. Make sure they're being heard, or we need to make sure that

431
00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.400
Robin Ham: were encouraging.

432
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:09.170
Robin Ham: Yeah, we're not just settling for

433
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:18.369
Robin Ham: something else. Yeah, this is a bit of a ramble, so you'll get a chance to also.

434
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:23.530
Edward Graham-Hyde: And how could you be supported more in some of that?

435
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:31.339
Robin Ham: So yeah. So one of my kind of hats is is

436
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:34.109
Robin Ham: admission community Co leader.

437
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:38.649
Robin Ham: in the town. And I think that that would look like.

438
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:45.210
Robin Ham: yeah, it kind of feels like as a diocese was slightly.

439
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:53.370
Robin Ham: We haven't really looked into the future enough and worked out how to at a local level help

440
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:58.129
Robin Ham: churches that are in decline and aren't sustainable.

441
00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.620
Robin Ham: and pccs that are struggling to get

442
00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.420
Robin Ham: people how to help them

443
00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:07.370
Robin Ham: just move into that next transition.

444
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:15.709
Robin Ham: And therefore what we do with the building and what we do. Because, yeah, it feels like there's there's not lots of pathways mapped out

445
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:27.690
Robin Ham: to follow. And and the admin, perhaps even the administrative support, isn't there to to make those things easier? And therefore people are more likely to be burdened with

446
00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:32.050
Robin Ham: responsibilities. As yet a smaller group of people burdened with more.

447
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:43.029
Robin Ham:  so I think the diocese talks a lot about new things and new ideas and a mixed ecology.

448
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:49.419
Robin Ham: and I think has been really good at championing, championing fresh expressions.

449
00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.799
But I think probably

450
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.280
Robin Ham: your average clergy person just feels

451
00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:02.400
Robin Ham: too swamped to to really. proactively give that a lot of time and space.

452
00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:06.899
Robin Ham: Right? maybe that. Yeah, that's probably my take, anyway.

453
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:09.180
Edward Graham-Hyde: that's fine.

454
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:21.890
Edward Graham-Hyde: that leads nice beyond to. We might have answered it there. But how could you, if at all, support other initiatives, kind of not necessarily as a resource church, but move, moving forward in terms of.

455
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:25.900
you know, new expressions, projects, initiatives, whatever they might be.

456
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:34.610
Robin Ham: Yeah, I mean, this is really live for us at the moment, because there are a couple of churches in the town couple of parishes that are really yeah, aren't viable.

457
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:38.469
Robin Ham: So having to work this out. So I guess this is why it's on my mind. But.

458
00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:46.959
Robin Ham: you know, we're talking about actually, will. Can this church not function as a parish church, but still function as a place of worship?

459
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:50.420
Edward Graham-Hyde: So we need to administratively make that really simple.

460
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:58.639
Robin Ham: Financially, we work. Want need to work out how to do that. In terms of who's gonna be managing its accounts and

461
00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:11.579
Robin Ham: making sure the building is maintained. So that we can continue to run ministry emission in that building, even though it's not no longer functioning as a parish with Pcc. Etc. Etc.

462
00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:18.960
Robin Ham:  and I think so. Yeah, simple. There is a heart to do that. And we're kind of entering into those conversations

463
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:24.189
Robin Ham: and seeing it more as an of a network or and a kind of a

464
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:30.160
Robin Ham: trying to grow, a kind of a strategic view of the town that is shared by all the churches.

465
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.580
Robin Ham:  yeah, I think

466
00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:40.119
Robin Ham: you know. And that's always like a it's a mentality shift, isn't it? In terms of kingdom

467
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:45.379
Robin Ham: rather than just. We need to preserve and maintain our church.

468
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:54.500
Robin Ham: But I think that's beginning to happen. man. I think one of the again, one of the challenges probably is like that is the

469
00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:02.140
Robin Ham: we feel we've got to maintain a whole range of traditions within the Church of England, because that's what being Church of England is.

470
00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:07.470
Robin Ham: And so I think there's always a rub point in terms of

471
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.860
Robin Ham: how do we? Yeah.

472
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.370
Robin Ham: to what extent is that possible?

473
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:20.810
Robin Ham: If if a certain church isn't growing, is the solution. To make sure there's a growing expression in that tradition, or do we

474
00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:29.480
Robin Ham: try something different? And those are quite painful conversations locally, and I think sometimes, maybe at a higher up level, it's harder.

475
00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:41.830
Robin Ham: It's a good. almost. You feels like you're reliant on people making having harder decisions, making those harder decisions. But if they don't aren't made, then it makes it more messy locally.

476
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:54.000
Edward Graham-Hyde: That makes sense. Yeah, it does make sense. Yeah, yeah, and appreciate time is running on the next kind of 4 questions are

477
00:56:54.120 --> 00:57:07.740
Edward Graham-Hyde: all the same, they're basically what inspiring stories about. And then following daily, can you share? And then so on, speaking boldly, you can see where it's going, and happy to go through them. Now I'm also happy for you to kind of if you'd rather

478
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:14.620
Robin Ham: have a bit more time to reflect, type them out. And in an email later stage, really, your preference.

479
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.429
Robin Ham: yeah, I mean, I?

480
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:23.449
Robin Ham: yeah, I I'm happy to write because I think that probably might

481
00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:34.289
Robin Ham: off based on a verbal processes. So you'll get the you'll get the first version. And actually, the third fourth version might be better. So maybe, yeah, I think that's probably something I could definitely easily do.

482
00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:42.070
Edward Graham-Hyde: Okay, well, let's let's get that question, then or that series of questions. And then I mean, you can. Also, I mean.

483
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:59.510
Edward Graham-Hyde: you might wanna also highlight other people that you either think I should talk to, or you might want to talk to them about those stories as well. So that's one. And I have 2 really quick. 5 questions, and then we're done so as part of the effective advances in project. I'm creating a

484
00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:12.319
Edward Graham-Hyde: a database. Well, hopefully, it will kind of met a database. I'm asking 2 quick questions. And I'm getting gut reactions to them. And then I'm basically gonna have thousands and thousands of responses from across different church streams.

485
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:19.529
Edward Graham-Hyde: And on? Yeah, on these questions. So the first one is, what is evangelism to you? In a sentence.

486
00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:24.500
Robin Ham: Evanism is sharing

487
00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.900
Robin Ham: verbally the hope of the good news of Jesus

488
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:36.230
Robin Ham: with be with people who who do don't know. It makes evangelism effective.

489
00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:47.340
Robin Ham: I guess I would say on one level. God's power, the Holy Spirit work.

490
00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:50.790
Robin Ham:  another level

491
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:52.500
Robin Ham: people

492
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:58.559
Robin Ham: knowing and loving other people. So people being known by people

493
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:05.490
Robin Ham: they know and and sharing in the context of of that

494
00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:07.190
Robin Ham: relationship.

495
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:11.859
Edward Graham-Hyde: Very good, very good. I'm just gonna do this, anyway.
